Fresh lemon aroma with light hops. Taste is also fresh lemonade. Take some discretionary pale lager, but lemon slice on the bottle and enjoy after sauna. Extra lemon save you and you can enjoy it, if you dont have fresh lemon with you.

Pale yellow-golden colour, off-white head with very good retention and lacing. Weak cat peey floral aroma, pineapple and mango, somewhat pungent, resiny and also candy-like. No good feelings about this, seems too light and watery. Tastes as disappointing - not bad but just kinda featherweight. Frutiy, sweet, somewhat juicy, orangeish bitter. It seems like a 5% sessionable Ale if not for the slight warmth in the throat mixing pretty nicely with the resiny bitterness. Light body, carbonation nearing flat. Not bad but I kinda expected much more (given the 97 score and all).", "similarity": 0.907}]}
