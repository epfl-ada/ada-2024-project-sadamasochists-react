Smooth as a baby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bottom, goes down as easily as water, the foam is thick, creamy and satisfying. The aroma is slightly bitter but hides a slight whiff of burnt almonds and brown sugar. The taste is unmatched, best served with a bowl of cereal (honey nut cheerios) and sausages.

The aroma outstandingly displays the contrast between bitterness and a fruity finish, blended to perfection with an aftertaste of top tier single malt whiskey (along the lines of Highland Park). The taste might be overwhelming at first but after a few sips, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find yourself charmed by its complexity.
