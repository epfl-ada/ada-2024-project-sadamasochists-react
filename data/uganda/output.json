Thin body definitly a porter as opposed to a stout. Not unpleasant not great meh-I think the labels promise of liqourice,chocolate and black left me expecting a thicker stout..", "similarity": 0.851}, {"text": "Bottled-keep coming back to this beer,its got the classic light ale flavours balanced perfectly,initial malt sweetness complemented by the hops coming through and refeshing leaving you wanting more. Nice bready flavour characteristic of english ale is present without being too yeasty or coarse.", "similarity": 0.82}, {"text": "This beer tastes like urine, syrup or no.  I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe anyone could brew a liquid with this kind of pee aroma and aftertaste.      I normally dig Nodding Head beers, but not this time.", "similarity": 0.803}]}
