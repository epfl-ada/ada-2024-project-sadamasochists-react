I must hide under thawb and not dress like western man until I lower weight. I try for working extra time in field, but each evening I come home and crave much refresh beer. I try this ultra amber beer for hoping to still enjoy a delish beer flavour with less calorie (95). It taste OK, similar to my cousin Zahra kofta meat dish....it have low flavour and I have had much better. I will drink anyway and hope to become much sexy man.", "similarity": 0.811}, {"text": "I love this spl beer with taste of sour like tart cherry. At first sip my lip pucker and I can taste many rock fruit blend of cherry, apricot or even peach. This beer I select from store at recommend from shop owner who know I am a man who like full boost flavour. He tell me this is spl b\u00e2\u0080\u0099coz of aging in barrel like fine wine.
