It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sold in Big C\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for a bit more premium than the typical Thai beers but practically never found in any bars, I guess it just got too much taste for average expat Joe. Giving it the highest score here as it really is the only Thai made beer you can place on the premium category.", "similarity": 0.859}, {"text": "grapefruit/nectarine turning resiny on nosing. the malt backbone in relation to bitter hop content is nearly perfect. very long clean & dry finish. this is f\u00e2\u0080\u0099ing fantastic!!!!", "similarity": 0.835}, {"text": "God in heaven save me from this muck.
