Purchased @ De Hopduvel. Brygget: 03.06.13. BBF 03.06.18. GUSHER (a minor one). Pours murky orange with a very patchy off-white head. Nose is hugely lactic red wine, murky, rotting red berries, Greek yoghurt, ditch water lemon, barnyard, light acidity, touch sourness,\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Akin to an USA sour but feels like an accident, is this beer supposed to be sour, wild & lactic? Taste is very milky, yeast, lactic red wine, big yoghurt & rather grainy, spoiled red fruits, rotting red grapes, light tannins, strongly yeasty, light yoghurt,\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Murky yeast & yoghurt dominates too heavily, needs to be thinner, cleaner but than again none of this feels even remotely intentional. An okay USA-style sour, I suppose & possibly an infection that turned out rather decently. Odd.", "similarity": 0.918}, {"text": "Bottle shared with Wim. Light amber coloured beer with some very light carbonation and a small white head. Almost skunky oily hinted aroma. Medium to full palate. Finish is sweet light wattery herby hinted.

Uhm yeah,... Taste is grainy, very stale malt, sugar, grain, vegetable, green appel, very weak given the hops etc, bit vegetable, lacking hop,... Body is grain, vegetable,... Tackles a concept lacking all basics.", "similarity": 0.905}]}
