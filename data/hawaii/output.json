All of that aside, I love this beer.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rich but smooth at the same time.  It goes down easily and the pecan pairs nicely with the hops.

It will not disappoint.", "similarity": 0.909}, {"text": "I grew up on this beer ( I also grew up in NZ born and raised), and the last time I consumed a large quantity was when my boss won the lottery when it first started in NZ, I even owned a t-shirt, lion brown more of a beer, I wore that t-shirt day and night...sigh... what a beer it was, the times I spent with this beer, wow what a sweet memory! can anyone mail me some over by any chance?", "similarity": 0.834}]}
