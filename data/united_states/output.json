Pours a clear brown cola color with a small off-white head.  Aroma of roasted malts, brown sugar, chocolate, vanilla, toast, and mild spices.  Flavor is led by brown sugar, chocolate, and vanilla, sweet overall, and roasty late.  Some notes of wood.  Light-medium bodied, with a smooth, syrupy mouthfeel.  Not a bad porter but nothing special.", "similarity": 0.918}, {"text": "12 ounce bottle. Clean orange pour. Nicely hopped with some tropical fruit notes. Good.", "similarity": 0.917}]}
