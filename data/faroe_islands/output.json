Quite hazy almost muddy orange colour. Fair lacing. Sweet good frutiness in the aroma.

Aroma of toasted malts, some caramel and bit fruity. Clean nice flavour of caramel, toasted malts. Dryish aftertaste with just a touch of the sweet caramel. Short aftertaste. Pretty good for a \"classic\" beer style.", "similarity": 0.897}, {"text": "Can. Pours a clear golden colour with a  bubbly and creamy rather short lasting white head leaving a fair lacing. Aroma of bitterish hops, grains and some malt. The mouthfeel is a bit waterish. The flavour is mild with a soft pleasant bitterness, some grains and malt. A simple but not bad at all pale lager. Well lasting bitter finish.", "similarity": 0.895}]}
