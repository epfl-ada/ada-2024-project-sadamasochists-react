Such a pity for something that was the original. In saying that though, there is no reason why knocking off a dozen bottles should have to be a chore. This beer is dry, refreshing and leaves you feeling satisfied that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve purchased just the right thing to have with your camambert while you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching the cricket.", "similarity": 0.895}, {"text": "Draft. Another impressive Liberty beer. Very clear light yellow with a small white head. Sweet sultana aroma. Deliciously refreshing dry grassy hop flavour without much bitterness. Not a strong flavour, but not overly simple either. Some yeasty favours in the background. A good showcase of Nelson hops.", "similarity": 0.894}, {"text": "A delicious beer. Black with a tan head. Aroma is complex with milky coffee, chocolate, caramel, and toffee. Similar flavours on the palate, with a pleasant sweetness which is more than I usually like in a beer, but is perfect in this one. A sweetish finish, with lingering coffee and toffee/caramel.", "similarity": 0.893}]}
