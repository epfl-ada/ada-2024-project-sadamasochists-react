A Carlsberg Kazakhstan beer. The Kronenbourg 1664 sold in Kazakhstan by Carlsberg Kazakhstan has a 4.5% ABV. Nothing special but I do feel as though there is a unique taste despite it being a mass produced lager.", "similarity": 0.856}, {"text": "Bought in a shop in Kazakhstan. This was a rather uninspiring beer. There was nothing that bad about it but nothing good about it. It only comes in a 0.64 litre bottle and to be honest I could have done without the extra 0.14 litres as it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly a beer to saviour.", "similarity": 0.812}, {"text": "Bought from a supermarket in Kyrgyzstan. I found it rather light and refreshing although tasting rather average and lacking any character. Towards the end I went off the taste somewhat and would therefore rate this lager just below average.", "similarity": 0.805}]}
