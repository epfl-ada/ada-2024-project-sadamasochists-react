Sweet notes on the aroma with some berries sparks like cherries and raspberries, some malty fel too. Hopy flavoured at first with malty notes on the taste. Medium sweetness and delicious medium to heavy bitterness. Fresh mouthfeel. The alcohol level was almost unperceptible until the pint was almost empty. Full body, creamy, soft carbonation and a nice mid-long bitter aftertaste. Good work from the hombrewers Dr. Klems & Schouskjelleren brewers! I hope there will come many more!", "similarity": 0.88}, {"text": "Very good, althoug tipical lager. very refreshing, and gives a very short bitter palate. Crisp. Ok.", "similarity": 0.875}, {"text": "K, reviewing this out of a glass bowl - pintbypint can back me on this via video RB chat. i can smell the cigs pint is sucking into him decaying lungs. lets hope that that is not the cause for a shitty review on my part. Bronze brew with a huge light tan head. Pint said : Nose has light hops and toasted malts and light caramel. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll agree with that mainly due to the fact that this bowl can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t retain aroma to save its life. K, lapping it up llike a cat has failed as I spilt it all over the table and my pants.... I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said that before.. doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t taste all that fantastic - certainly not worthy of this high end bowl. Mild hops and mild roast make way for a mild hop thing. The fruit comes in like cotton candy then changes instantly to nothing of importance. Short lived bitterness. A mild beer that I can say I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get again even though it was not a bad beer.", "similarity": 0.875}]}
