Gorgeous, hazy amber/brown body and toasted white head. Chewy/syrupy in the mouth. Taste is bigtime coffee flavored malt with more alcohol. The coffee taste really surprised me. Aftertaste is super-malt, coffee and more alcohol. Not as complex as I had hoped for. I'd deem this average to slightly above average for the style.", "similarity": 0.876}, {"text": "Orange body, greyish darker portion on inch below head.  Hazy. Foam is thick and white, lovely. Clove, spice, coriander, honey, and acidic citrus ping the nose. Big, full taste, lighter citrus fruits with plenty of spice, mlasses/caramel lightly, sweet on palate. Decent amount of dryness from hops and alcohol. Decent laccing. Aftertaste is drying but good.", "similarity": 0.872}, {"text": "Standard pub lager. Sampled on draught at Di Biers in Melbourne, Australia. Very low key beer. Gold body with white head. Smells or rice, skunky malts and hops. Taste is carbonated water and malt. Aftertaste is more pleasant than most cheap beer.", "similarity": 0.862}]}
