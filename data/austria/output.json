Amber color, off-white head. Flavor is grainy, corny, few to no hops. Watery taste, more like a colored lager.", "similarity": 0.901}, {"text": "From tap at Beaver Brewing Company, Vienna. Clear golden color with a white head. Intense, hoppy aroma: peach, passion fruit, some pine, sweet citrus fruits. Light to medium body with a medium to heavy, rather harsh bitterness. The flavor is lightly malty (dark bread) and quiet full for the low ABV with a heavy hoppy bitterness, which overpowers the fruity notes of oranges and grapefruits. Not a lot of fruitiness left in the flavor, which is quiet disappointing after the aroma. Not bad but for me it is way to bitter and unbalanced.", "similarity": 0.898}, {"text": "500 ml bottle. Pours a light amber with an off-white head. Surprising aroma with honeydew melon, mead, slightly malty. Medium body with an average carbonation, a light sweetness and a light bitterness. The flavor is malty (grains), hints of citric fruits and honey with a lightly bitter hoppy finish.", "similarity": 0.895}]}
