Ruikt naar koffie, peat, port, zoetig. Smaakt fantastisch, koffie, rook, weinig zoet, redelijk bitter. Super!", "similarity": 0.919}, {"text": "Pours hazy amber with a cloudy stable white head. Malty aroma with fruity tones. Orange, citrus... Bit acidic as well. Tastewise, it is mildly sweet and light, with a faint yeasty touch. Clear presence of the fruits, with a mildly hopbitter touch in the aftertaste. It ends smoothly dry, yet there is a small spicy kick present. Bit warmish as well. Not that groundbreaking, but definitely well-made. Sticky texture, full bodied and lively carbonated. In general, this is quite good. Despite the 8% abv. this is quite a soft and smooth brew.", "similarity": 0.918}, {"text": "On Tap @ Copenhagen festival 2011. The aroma has coffee, roast, ash, juniper.
