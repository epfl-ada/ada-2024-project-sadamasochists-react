Deeply inhaling the vapor immediately flooded my frontal lobe with adjectives and my primitive midbrain with a myriad long-forgotten flavor associations and memories. Free association seems like the only way to properly document this experience:Christmas puddingChristmas treeOverripe pineapples. Well worn Leather briefcases.Clove cigarettes.Hickory woodsmoke.Fat back.Mussels covered in delta mud.Wet yew tree bark.A fresh cherry twig in the mouth. Held, not chewed.Wet chewed stogie.Burnt milk and creme bruleeCarmelized coffee beansSipping sherry.A stroll through the dockside streets of Porto along the warehouses.Just an entirely trippy experience and a testament to the skill of the evil geniuses at DSB for being able to evoke such turgid emotion and florid imagination from a sip of the ungodly nectar that they teased out of water, grain and the rich ether of experience and skill.Very highly recommended.", "similarity": 0.878}, {"text": "3.5%ABV.
