Hazy orange amber color with thin creamy off-white head and average sparkling appearance. Aroma of tropical fruits, citrus, caramel and pine. Taste starts with moderate sweet biscuit malt, following is resinous and fruity sour with slightly dry mouthfeel and heavy bitter finish. Full body, oily texture and average carbonation in palate. Effervescent reservoir of essential life saving liquid :)", "similarity": 0.903}, {"text": "0,5 l can. Pours crystal clear, light straw with big frothy white dissipating head, does leave some lacing. Aroma of malt. Very light, hardly any hop aroma present of all. Taste is light sweet, bitterness is barely noticeable. Body is light to say the least, texture is watery, carbonation is average. Absence of any kind of finish. Slight metallic taste is present. Completely pointless, it leaks any kind of beer taste, but at least it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not offensive like some other cheap cheap beer.", "similarity": 0.897}, {"text": "29. 1. 2017, Ljubljana. Bottled. Clear IPA with extra hoppiness for the bitterness kick in the aftertaste. Aroma very subdued, probably because of filtration.---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone", "similarity": 0.894}]}
