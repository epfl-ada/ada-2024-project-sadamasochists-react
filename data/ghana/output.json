Being from the USA, this beer is stong and ready to leave you a little drunk in no time. Drink three of these and Ghana becomes a GREAT place to live. Drink 4 and be ready to sleep. I would much rather have this than ANY beer sold in the USA. A word of advice, clean the top of your bottle after you open it.", "similarity": 0.819}, {"text": "Draught version - creamy, smooth, thick, and creamy with overtones of chocolate ganache and undertones of carmel and golden syrup.
