Ceral smell, good. Golden color, white low head. Mild taste with character. Good overall, but nothing to speak about it actually.", "similarity": 0.897}, {"text": "Pours sparkling and bright gold with a big white fluffy head.On the nose it shows itself malty with fresh cereal and bready notes. Green olives and fine herbal notes are present too giving it a crisp aroma.Flavor is nice, very agreeable clean and subtle. Fresh herbal notes come caressing my palate. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not strong by any means and some people might complain it is watery. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nice for food pairings, especially fish. On the palate it is a simple, smooth, light bodied lager. The clean finish leaves almost no aftertaste. By far the Damm I like the most so far.", "similarity": 0.884}, {"text": "330cc bottle from Club de Cervezas. Pours a very dark brown/mahogany color with a small, good lacing, off-white head that leaves a film. Aroma is malty, roasted, with moderate intensity. Notes of deep roasted coffee grains, espresso, burnt tobacco, milk, brown sugar and almond Pralin\u00c3\u00a9. Classic but slightly restrained. Taste has moderate sweetness with expressive toasted and roasted touches. Besides the burnt notes, there is some ashy hints and traces of prunes and dry figs. Really tasty, almost as flavorful as some Oatmeal Stouts I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had, just a little flatter. Light bodied for a Stout, medium-high carbonation, mild aftertaste. Good sessionable Stout. I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve discovered where the Mestiza line is going: They are aiming at highly drinkable, sessionable and unassuming beers to pair with food.", "similarity": 0.882}]}
