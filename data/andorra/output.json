Yeasty aroma, with undertones of spice and banana. Taste slightly sour, with some bitter hops at the end. Nice palate, with a mild carbonation that is fresh but keeps the flavor well. A refreshing average weizen.", "similarity": 0.857}, {"text": "Brown ruby body, untroubled, with a small light beige head. Roasted nuts and caramels nose, without smokiness. Chocolate, caramel and malt flavors pour into the mouth. They are very well balanced in a medium carbonated body. Finish is sweet and lasting, but not overpowering. An excellent dunkel close to greatness.", "similarity": 0.852}, {"text": "From 75cl bottle, BB 06/02/09. Orange cloudy body with chunks and a small bubbly head quickly disappearing leaving little lacing. Floral and malty nose with some touches of banana yeast. Slight sour citric approach in mouth, apricot  tones and roasted malts with a nice sweet finish. Round body with a small carbonation gives some seriosity to this spring beer without taking away its light spirit. A very nice brew that loves the spring weather but could be better if its looks were more lively.", "similarity": 0.85}]}
