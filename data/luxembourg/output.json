Burgundy with thin off-white head. Hoppy with a sweetish malt nose. Some old fruit there. Malty taste and easy to drink, slightly bitter, winter fruit. Slightly watery, but with hints of spice. Alcohol in the palate, quite fruity though.", "similarity": 0.902}, {"text": "Blond beer looks a bit like white beer. Grassy hoppy sour.Probably excellent in summer when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thirsty.", "similarity": 0.889}, {"text": "Bright golden opalescent offering a frothy white head and very good lacings. Aromas of barnyard funk, citrus zest, fruity esters, lemon peel, hints of lychee and lemongrass develop. Light effervescent, bright texture, light body. Brisk whaff of malt-cereal sweetness with a hoppy citrussy touch and pleasant funky flavours offering light dryness and astringency in a harmonic lasting finish.", "similarity": 0.887}]}
