It has a very thin white head. Medium carbonation. Chocolate, caramel, light vanilla and coffee in aroma and flavor. It is definitively a very decent doppelbock with extra aroma and flavor because of the American oak where it matured.", "similarity": 0.858}, {"text": "Hazy orange, complex fruity and malty flavor and aroma, very smooth. Can taste target, fuggles and Golding hops. Great beer, more like a cognac than Golden Pride. Will try it again, definitively.", "similarity": 0.853}, {"text": "I bought this beer because it has some awards, Chilean, latinoamerican and Australian. A disappointment, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have body, aroma and flavor is vegetables like a soy sauce and vegetables cooked in a wok with some roasted malt. A very weird beer.", "similarity": 0.851}]}
