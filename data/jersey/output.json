Quite dark, bitter and fruity, very refreshing. This beer just gets better the more you drink - the bitterness can be quite noticable at first but as you get used to it the palate recognises the other complexities present in the beer. Slightly spicy, malty and roasted. V good.", "similarity": 0.846}, {"text": "cask, somewhere in Bedfordshire countryside. really didnt enjoy this, bland and weak, with a definate taste of Burtonian sulpher which doesnt suit. An IPA? im not sure even if the brewery can decide whether this is a bitter or an IPA, ive seen it advertised as both. My long term ambition/ dream is to open a microbrewery, and if by some miracle i become anywhere near as successful as Charles Wells and start brewing beer as boring as the Wells flagship beers, you have my permission to shoot me.", "similarity": 0.843}, {"text": "A good beer, with good hop flavours. Not hugely remarkable but a pleasant session beer worthy of your attention.", "similarity": 0.841}]}
