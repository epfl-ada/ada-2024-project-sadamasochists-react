Great hoppy nose, couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe it was a barley wine. Perfectly balanced palate, you can taste the alcohol, but incredibly drinkable.", "similarity": 0.895}, {"text": "Bottle from Cesky Krumlov. Medium gold color, slightly darker than I expected. Decent, light foamy head that fades quickly. Pretty rich malt aroma. A touch of sweetness, even toffee and honey. Surprising. A touch of hops. Flavor is less malty, and ultimately less pleasing, than the aroma. Decent hops with a touch of melon-like fruit. A bit of that cardboard taste as well, though, which is slightly unpleasant. Light body. Relatively light carbonation. Finish is quite bitter indeed, just a touch of thin malt. Overall not very interesting. Easy to drink, but nothing I would go out of my way for.", "similarity": 0.893}, {"text": "Bottle from KBL. Funky acid nose, hibiscus, passion fruit, some vinegar, and a bit of veggie that got stronger as it opened up. Dark gold, cloudy, with lace and lots of carbonation. Huge passion fruit flavor at first, raspberry, rhubarb. Nicely tart. Light and a bit thin, spicy, interesting and fun, though the flavor seem to turn quite vegetal as it warmed, which really turned me off.", "similarity": 0.891}]}
