I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure I would agree with the consideration of Tafel as a smooth beer, but the CO2 accentuates the flavour, dissipating it across the palate.", "similarity": 0.796}, {"text": "excellent fresh sorghum aroma. a tangy traditional african beer taste and a powerful kick that only real men can take. the particles are the only turn off in this wonderfully refreshing beer of rere quality.", "similarity": 0.784}, {"text": "Sorry, but I really enjoyed this belgian brew. I enjoyed many bottles on my visit to Brugge..and back in London. This is my favorite beer of the moment. Easy to drink, refreshing, great aroma, possibly could do with a little more character and a longer lasting head, but tastes great nonetheless. Nice balance(to me) in a classic belgian way;ie not too hoppy and a little (not too much)sweet. Also great logo! Reminds me slightly of Radegast, my fav czech brew.", "similarity": 0.754}]}
