Smell is weak. Taste is a little hoppy with a touch of sweet barley malt. Not my preferred beer but would drink it anytime in a hot humid weather.", "similarity": 0.801}, {"text": "This Pilsener is refreshing, dry and crisp. It pours a nice yellow tone with high carbonation. Head is high with good retention. I enjoyed this in a hot day, so I find it very proper for thirst quencher. Nice beer, not the greatest but I can drink two or three easily.", "similarity": 0.798}]}
