Tenants super is too gassy!!.. just makes you wana burp and throw up..    Gold label just abit too much, too harsh really.   Carlsberg special brew is quite close to skol super but abit harsh/rough for my liking.. ..   I think skol super is top notch, great taste, no gas, looks great, smells great.  A very welcoming larger with a great smooth and gradual alcohol taste and affect to it without any grumpyness unlike the others that make you suffer as you drink them.", "similarity": 1.0}]}
