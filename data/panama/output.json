Aroma is pleasing with honey, gingerbread, and ginger candy notes. Flavor is dominated by malts, with some raisin elements and ice tea highlights, no off flavors and an INCREDIBLY smooth finish. I guess that the leadup to this beer left me wanting a bit more...is that fair? Certainly a very nice beer, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try other Belgain offerings before I return to this. 5.50 USD at the bottle shop in Anchorage....in Panama the beer sucks but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheap, I guess the opposite is going to be true for this trip to Alaska.Re-rate on the finish of the bottle. Definately grew on me....the flavor stayed with the beer through the warming, with more floral and ice tea notes. Quite, quite nice. Love Belgian beer...", "similarity": 0.875}, {"text": "Wow...this beer is complex. I really liked it. Yes you can taste the alchohol on the finish, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great. To me, it was like a mix of an Imperial IPA and a stout, since both the strong hoppy bitterness was there as well as a nice malt backbone. Great, because it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sweet, rather it had a huge, long dry finish. It poured a deep copper with a long lasting head and a superb aroma. In the mouth was a whole medley of different flavors, with a long, somewhat hot finish. It is a serious beer, a contemplative beer that you really need to drink slowly. Too bad it warmed up too much here in Panama. A note, my wife, who really likes good, hoppy beer didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like this beer...it was too much. Special thanks to James Maley for bringing this beer to Panama.", "similarity": 0.861}]}
