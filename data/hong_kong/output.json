Thin but creamy palate.Mouth Feel: Solid maltyness in a slightly watery yet very smooth background with notable wheaty tartness. Low-fi grapefruit and citrus echo the floral and pretty light sweetness. Yeasty with light lemon to round. Light and refreshing!Hoppiness: Strong passion fruits, canned peaches, pineapples, strong floral, lemon and light grass in nose. Light grapefruits, citrus, yellow fruits, floral, light lemon and grass in taste; Bitterness is close to medium for a lasting, fairly astringent grassy finish.After Taste: Fairly dry. Smooth and light bitter to mouth.Comments: This is pretty much in the mould of Session IPA with very nice tropical fruity aroma, yet taste is light touch of malt and hops with smooth palate and relaxing impression on all fronts. Pretty well-made already but stronger hop taste and variety will be ever better.

Malt has strong roastyness and nuttiness, but was overshadowed by sharp spikes of sour notes, ended up with lingering sour milk palate. No!... Coffee, toffee and chocolate tastes are too light to hide the non-sweet Cola taste, no oat smoothness to speak of. Very so-so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Hoppiness is light grass nose, lemon and light grass in taste. Bitterness is very low, not enough to balance the sour milk taste, ended in an abrupt low bitter finish; Slightly dry after taste. Easy but sour to mouth.Comments: The moment it was popped, I saw no gas came out of the bottle, a bad sign: it has virtually no head, no carbo, minimal lacing, Cola looking. Good roasty and nutty aroma and taste aside, it tastes more like a flat Cola, with toffee / chocolate and hop tastes so underwhelming, and that strong sour notes really ruined the drinking experience. Very disappointing.
