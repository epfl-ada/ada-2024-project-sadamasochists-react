Floral aroma comes out in the taste, am new to tasting/rating.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dark-amber in colour. A thin but creamy cap of light tan foam tops it but dissipates shortly. Still, it maintains a wide collar and whispy surface covering, and leaves some splotchy and spotty lace behind.Coffee leaps out at you in the aroma!!! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rich and bright.In the mouth it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smooth with a medium body; moderate, perhaps even restrained, carbonation; and slight oiliness from the coffee.As in the nose, coffee flavor dominates, rich and wide, but also interacting with the malt and hop flavors.", "similarity": 0.744}, {"text": "Taste like beer infused with vodka.
