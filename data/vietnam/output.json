A reasonable offering which is clear and pours with a small, slightly off white head. Not on the same par as the original Sapporo, but it still retains a surprisingly smooth hint of bitterness on swallowing, although this is still very mild when compared to the original. Quite refreshing and certainly worth a punt.", "similarity": 0.811}, {"text": "Doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look too bad on pouring, but it all goes downhill from there.
