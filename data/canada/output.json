Pours with a nice billowy head which collapses into a dirty yellow colour. Hint of citrus flavour, slightly spicy and a heavy \"fremented\" taste to it. Overall, not too bad, but not one I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll rush out to buy again.", "similarity": 0.91}, {"text": "Bottle courtesy of geth_in_beer.  Many thanks.  Deep brown beer with rich garnet highlights.  The aroma is quite nice, light cocoa and a soft coffeeish aroma on the nose.  Some light roast and a touch of tartness.  Very light-bodied.  OK, but not great.", "similarity": 0.907}, {"text": "Bottle - Boozy, honey, herbal and spice. Hazy orange with no head. Very sweet syrupy, spices and booze. A sweet syrupy mess.", "similarity": 0.902}]}
